## JavaSocketReader

This program can be used to view contents of a socket connection.

### How To Use

When you start the program it will ask you for a server IP, server port and in port.

Server IP is a address of a socket that the program should connect to.

Server port is the port of the socket.

In port is a port that the program will open.

Then in a console you should see a connection between the socket connected into the in port and the server.
